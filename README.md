Analytical Modeling and Optimization of Electronic Soft Actuator
===
## Introduction

## Usage
In the "Magnetic_Field_Force_(Magnetic_Vector_Potential)" folder, Matlab code that calcualtes the force and magnetic field using Magnetic Vector Potential(MVP) methods are provided.
To run the code, first add "Utility_Functions" into your Matlab Path, see "include_path.png" for detailed instructions.
After that, run "plot_xx_yy.m" to observe field and force calculations discussed in the paper.

In the "Mixed_Integer_Non_Linear_Programming_MATLAB" folder, there are two m-files: one for the main program and another dedicated to auxiliary calculations. To obtain the optimization results, please run the main file. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us for further clarification.
