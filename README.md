In the "Magnetic_Field_Force_(Magnetic_Vector_Potential)" folder, Matlab code that calcualtes the force and magnetic field using Magnetic Vector Potential(MVP) methods are provided.
To run the code, first add "Utility_Functions" into your Matlab Path, see "include_path.png" for detailed instructions.
After that, run "plot_xx_yy.m" to observe field and force calculations discussed in the paper.
